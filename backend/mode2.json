        "explanation": "### Explanation of Drift Detection Using the ADWIN Algorithm\n\nThe **ADWIN (Adaptive Window**) algorithm is a change detection method that monitors the performance of a model over time. It uses a sliding window to keep track of the data points and their performance metrics. When a significant change is detected, it triggers an alert.\n\n### Key Metrics:\n- **KS Statistic**: A measure of the maximum distance between the empirical cumulative distribution functions of two samples. A value of 1 indicates a perfect separation.\n- **KS P-value**: The p-value associated with the KS statistic, indicating the significance of the observed difference.\n- **Wasserstein Distance**: A measure of the distance between two probability distributions. A higher value indicates a larger difference.\n- **Mean MSE Reference**: The mean squared error of the reference model.\n- **Mean MSE Current**: The mean squared error of the current model.\n- **MSE Threshold Value**: The threshold for MSE to determine if drift is present.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Drift Detected**: Yes\n- **Warning Detected**: No\n- **Drift Coverage**: 0.0%\n- **Warning Coverage**: 0.0%\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe model has detected a drift in the data, indicating that the current model may not be performing as expected. Further investigation and potential model retraining may be necessary."
